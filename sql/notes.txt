any char a-z and any number 0-9
        1-26                27-36

bob123

math the chars to the numbers

2
15
2
27
28
29

add them up 
19+ 27+ 28+ 29 = 103

random num and divide by 6 + 17.1666666 // store this value 
// this is the hashed password

goal is to make my hashed function a one-way function
easy to make a hash, but very hard to go the other way

chances of collision(can it be unhashed or figured out) to be as close to zero as possible



echo "bob123" | SHA256sum  // example of how I enter this in to see password 

salt is an extra random string that goes before the password
token is a secret that goes after the password hash

salt.pwdhash.token

chances of collision to be as close to zero as possible is the goal
